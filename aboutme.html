<b>Is what we call it "About Me" thingy?</b>
<br> <br>
If you hate long reading, then simply type "ashumeow" in google search. You will get 80% surely about me. <br>
It was May 14th 1991 8.30PM so dark, the time when the WWW was already born baby as well as Linux. That was the time when a dangerous moron was born, who was named as Aswini.
<br> <br>
<b>Education Background:- </b><br>
Now, she is now a 23 year old geek who loves computers since ever 2nd grade (1997) when she started operating Windows 95. At beginning, she enjoyed playing dave and prince. Also, she liked documents and kills the operating system. Aswini was not a nerd (though most of them call her as studious during school days), but she loves learning. The great Aswini used to fail in all the subjects beautifully except Science in 1st grade & she always scores above 90. At 2nd grade, she got good in math. At 3rd grade, she got good in handwriting... wait... That's not a subject actually... During 4th grade (1999), she was introduced into a minor subject called Computer Science where it was given less importance and that actually became her favorite subject especially when her lab partners used to ask her:- You type faster and you type program faster, that made her self-motivated. Ever since then, she often spends all her summer vacations going for computer classes with her brother. 
<br>She started wearing specs from 6th grade... oh geeky, right? After finishing 7th grade, while in summer holidays, she learned web designing using HTML. She learned B in her 9th grade. During 10th grade, she got good in flowcharts. During her high school, She was forced to take science (physics, chemistry, biology) and math, without computer science. So, she missed learning C and C++, she notices in her school notice-board regarding computer contests, but she couldn't go since her major subjects were already tough. She undergone tough phase during high school and her score was less in 12th grade, which made her miss the chance of getting into BITS though she passed her entrance, but got inelgibile to join since her 12th grade overall score and MPC average was below 80%. Yet, she wasn't de-motivated. She managed joining into some college and pursued her BTech in Information Technology. It was hard time since that was her first time exposed in outside world for 4 years, where she learned to be partially independent. Since she gave less importance to math except calculus in her high school, she failed in all her math papers. That actually helped her build math learning skill. Since her major subject wasn't computer science and she didn't receive any help, she spent extra hours attempting to understand programming so hard. She never attempted to memorize any program, but she tried to understand code. She became strong in programming after properly learning C#  which automatically helped to get good in C, C++ and Java. <br> Also, Aswini used to attend several workshops and competitions, where her professors still now doesn't know. Aswini also hidden her ambition and love for Microsoft, never shared it with any of her college mates. And Aswini worked in mini-projects during her college in a team of four, where she will be the one doing coding and gives powerpoint plans, but her project teammates get good name, but Aswini never cared since she wanted to gain learning and knowledge experience. She somehow managed completing her BTech and graduated in 2012. <br>
Earlier, Aswini had no interest to do masters. She tried travelling across till deccan of India searching for jobs, but she never received a job. Accidently during job searching, she met some MBA girls and that gave her an idea to apply for MBA through distance. In the meantime, she successfully passed in DELF A1 and A2 in French. Also, she tried to do Hindi certification, but she dropped out. Aswini was not happy with her programming skills.  <br>
For few months, she was viewing research jobs and all it asked is either a work experience or masters in computer major. Aswini really wanted a challenging job, but doesn't have a work experience. So, she applied for Masters of Technology in Computer Science Engineering, though she hates academics. While attending class and reviewing the syllabus, Aswini got an overall idea of computers. 2013 was a changing year, where she developed love for operating systems and micro-processors, which were her most-hated subjects in her BTech. Whatever subjects she hated in BTech to the core, it gradually became the subjects she likes to spend time. But, Aswini hates academics since she gets "bad luck" and found it limited. Earlier, she spends most of the time in library. Aswini wanted to build an operating system. When people were busy building applications, Aswini wants to build something beyond it. She found many ambitious coders in github. She joined github in late 2013, because nobody will believe someone as a good coder unless they see their works. She started building repos and mostly ended up in failure. She saw many having awesome stuffs and She kept saying to herself:- I have to build awesome too. Seeing her bad luck performance in 1st semester, she was broken. One day, she brought her laptop to her class and started coding referring manuals. She couldn't remember most stuffs since it needs more experience, right? She was working on Operating Systems Networking independent projects where she managed coding several socket programs in windows, unix and bsd. <br>
Few months later, she realized that she requires to build projects that could produce possible outputs. Aswini always love to watch and read others innovative codings in gthub, codeplex and it helps her sharpen her code writing style. More than coding, the most toughest job is reading and understanding someone's code especially when there is no good comment lines provided. <br>
Blah Blah Blah... <br>
She got good in Java, which was her most-hated language and She often gets updated with Google news, which was the most-hated company. Whatever she hated most, she became good at it. Also, she loves Microsoft so much and other technologies and their innovations... <br>
One day... she accidently got dragged into Quantum Computing in Youtube... where she watched all the talks in Quantum research from Google, D-Wave and many lectures, where she even wrote and published a book within a month, though it was not that good, but she was happy with her attempt. In her quantum articles blog, she was highly appreciated and during that time, nearly 1000 visitors visited everyday. <br>
She wanted to do project in quantum computing, but she practically analyzed that this is not possible project for her since she studies in a college and she hates college. <br>
The quantum computing study research is in pause. But who knows? One day, she fixed a bug after a year suddenly. So, someday she might resume it. <br>
Continuing the story, she was into deep thinking. She then realized that web is a good solution because she was into web since 7th grade as said earlier. She wanted to work on security since her BTech project was on secure computing especially beacons. Yet, she admitted herself that security can be put as an enhancement in future. So what matters most is Performance, huh? She decided to do Performance thingy, eventhough she hated servers. Like we know:- Aswini gets good in what she hates the most. Javascript was her deadly enemy, but she is now working in Javascript creative coding and fixing bugs. <br>
But, this doesn't mean that she will hate what she likes. C'mon people! LOL <br>
<br> 
<b>Apart from Educational background:- </b>
<br>Aswini was into book reading habit since her 3rd grade and enrolled into public outside library memberships from 4th grade till 12th grade. She reads atleast 3 new books per week during school days apart from her school books. Aswini was an huge game addict till 12th grade. Most of them stopped after joining BTech, because she was staying in hostel. She got internet connection for her laptop during final year BTech project use. She learned Arduino in 2009 which was really a tough workshop that she took part outside college. She learned how computers and hardwares were manufactured attending few days training in HCL. During BTech, she participated in several other colleges workshops. So during MTech, she didn't like to participate in college workshop since she already participated and wants to learn more, so she often participated in Microsoft Developer Camps and Reboot. Also, she attended several online events without sleeping at nights since they were in US timings. Attending events helped her understand technologies. <br>
In march 2014, She was blocked by Google Cloud entering into top 10 honourable blacklist position. She knew that they hate her, right? They still don't forgive her. She asked for forgiveness studying Google Chrome on everything about it and their boring cute documents. Yet, she is updating their technologies and still they don't forgive this poor child. <br>
Her best thing in 2014 was attending in-person Microsoft TechEdIndia event where she received the reward of Nokia Lumia 925 (her first windows phone) and recognition for the "Most active individual in social media", where she had her first experience speaking infront of 2000 audience in stage. Hoping to achieve more! This is just level 1, right? <br>
Apart from Microsoft technologies, she participates in RedHat, Oracle, Intel and IBM live events... and also free live events conducted by other organization. <br>
I really wanna write more, but my wrist is paining and i need to save energy for coding.<br> <br>

<b><i>Personal life:-</b></i><br>
------------------------ Doors Closed----------------------------------

<b>Health:-</b><br>
Everyday, i do cardio. And what else? I am the princess of diarrhoea, which helps me to release my heavy deployment of food from the stomach. I hate smoking. I look healthy when i am deadly sick, whereas i look deadly sick when i am healthy. I am not addicted to any habits. <br> <br>
